The team involved in the lab work for the course CSC 4035 (Web Programming & Technologies) are:
1. Comfort Chapa
2. Mambwe Luke Chilebela

In this lab, I set up my web development environment by installing tools like Visual Studio Code, Git, and Node.js. I then created my first webpage using HTML, which included a
heading and a paragraph. I also learned how to use Git for version control, initialized a Git repository, and pushed my project to GitHub. 

The course is being lectured by Dr. Zipani Tom Sinkala.
